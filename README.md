# SOLID Principles Implementation in Laravel

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the application of the SOLID principles in a Laravel environment. The architecture includes interfaces, controllers, repositories, services, providers, requests, and responses, showcasing how these components interact to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable application.

## SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class has one responsibility. For example, the controller handles HTTP requests, while the service contains business logic.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. New functionality can be added by creating new classes or methods rather than altering existing ones.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. Interfaces ensure that derived classes can be used interchangeably.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Smaller, specific interfaces are used instead of a large, general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions. Dependency injection is employed throughout the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure, with key components as follows:

### Key Components

- **Interfaces**: Define contracts for repositories (e.g., `TestRepositoryInterface.php`).
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests (e.g., `TestController.php`).
- **Repositories**: Abstract data access logic (e.g., `TestRepository.php`).
- **Services**: Contain business logic (e.g., `TestService.php`).
- **Providers**: Register bindings in the service container (e.g., `RepositoryServiceProvider.php`).
- **Requests**: Validate incoming data (e.g., `StoreTestRequest.php`).
- **Responses**: Transform data for API responses (e.g., `TestResource.php`).
